// GOAL: Upgrade the Credit Simulator to simulate the estimated score change based on loan type and action (open new loan or pay off existing loan).

// CONTEXT: 
// - The current simulator displays a "Simulated Score" based on inputs.
// - I want to simulate a score *change* (positive or negative) instead, based on the action taken with a specific loan type.
// - Each loan type should have its own logic for score impact.

// TASK:
// 1. Update the simulator UI so that after selecting the loan type, the following fields appear conditionally:

//    Credit Card:
//      - Total Credit Card Debt
//      - Payoff Amount
//      - Are you opening a new credit card? (Yes/No)
//      - Number of currently open credit cards (optional, for bonus logic)

//    Auto Loan:
//      - Current Balance
//      - Choose Action: "Open New Auto Loan" or "Pay Off Auto Loan"

//    Student Loan:
//      - Loan Balance
//      - Deferment Status: "Paying", "In School", "Deferred"
//      - Any Missed Payments? Yes/No

// 2. Based on the selected loan type and input values, return a score *change*, not a simulated score. Example result:

//   "Your estimated score change is: -60 points"
//   "Simulated score: 640" (keep this below for visual reference)

// 3. Use the following logic model to estimate score changes (simplified, based on real-world behaviors):

const creditImpact = {
  "Credit Card": {
    payOff: (payoffAmt, totalDebt) => {
      const utilizationDrop = payoffAmt / totalDebt;
      if (utilizationDrop >= 0.9) return +30;
      if (utilizationDrop >= 0.5) return +15;
      if (utilizationDrop >= 0.25) return +5;
      return +0;
    },
    openNew: (cardsOpen) => cardsOpen >= 5 ? -10 : -5
  },
  "Auto Loan": {
    payOff: (balance) => balance > 1000 ? +10 : +2,
    openNew: () => -12
  },
  "Student Loan": {
    missedPayment: (status) => status === "Yes" ? -60 : 0,
    deferment: (status) => status === "In School" ? 0 : status === "Deferred" ? -5 : 0
  }
};

// 4. Update simulateScore() to apply this logic based on loan type.
// 5. Make the score change visually stand out (red for negative, green for positive).
// 6. If required fields are missing, disable the "Simulate Score" button.
